# Notes
```
Arrow keys (up-down) and enter key should be used. Please use them.
When you buy/sell crypto currencies, you can buy/sell them as decimal amounts.
If you buy/sell decimal amount, please use '.' instead of ','
If you will leave game, you must save game. If you do not save, you cannot reach the latest values.
I didn't add exchange system yet because it is like crypto currencies. Both systems are approximately the same.
